egypt's army says has no plans to pardon mubarak
egypt's ruling military council on wednesday dismissed speculation it would pardon former president hosni mubarak, who is under investigation for graft and abuse of power, and said it does not interfere in judicial affairs. mubarak, 83, is detained in a hospital in the red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh after officials said he had heart problems. his wife, suzanne, who also fell ill when ordered detained, was freed on tuesday after giving up assets but faces a graft probe.
